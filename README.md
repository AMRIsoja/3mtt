Calculator App
This is a web-based calculator application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app provides a user-friendly interface to perform basic arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It features a modern layout with a dual-display screen that shows the current expression and the result.
Key Features:
 * Interactive UI: A responsive and visually appealing design.
 * Full Expression Display: Shows the complete calculation as you type (e.g., 12 + 5 * 3).
 * Clear and Delete Functions: Includes buttons to clear the entire calculation (AC) and delete the last digit (x).
 * Percentage Calculation: Supports percentage operations (%).
 * Robust Logic: Handles operator precedence and prevents consecutive operator inputs.
This project was built to demonstrate fundamental web development skills in creating a functional and practical application from scratch for 3MTT course.
